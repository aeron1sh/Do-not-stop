# Do-not-stop
This andrioid app is intended to assist transit agencies, not transit passengers – with accurate collection, storage, and analysis of field data generated by surface vehicles (i.e., buses and streetcars) while in operation.

A diagram showing the functional design of the app can be seen below:

As it shows, the user’s selected route-information input will communicate with a server, which is in turn connected to a SQL Server database hosting the transit agency’s historical data. (This historical data is generated by existing equipment installed on vehicles). The user then sets desired filters/parameters for a route, and proceeds with analysis. The server returns existing dwell time estimates for the route of interest, and the mobile device’s GPS will gather data. Finally, the app computes results (key performance indicators).
